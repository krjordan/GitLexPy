# Contributing to GitLexPy

First off, thank you for considering contributing to GitLexPy. It's people like you that make GitLexPy such a great tool.

## Where to Start?

- **Beginners**: If you're new to the project and want to help, start by checking out the issues labeled as `good first issue` or `beginner-friendly`.
- **Bug reports**: If you've identified a bug, first check the existing issues to see if it's already been reported. If not, create a new issue providing a detailed description and steps to reproduce the bug.
- **Feature requests**: For new features, it's a good idea to first create an issue to discuss the new feature before making any significant changes.

## Steps to Contribute

1. **Setup your Environment**: Clone the repository and ensure you have all the prerequisites installed.
2. **Create a Branch**: Always make a new branch for your work.
3. **Make Changes**: Make your changes and commit them. Adhere to the commit message guidelines.
4. **Test**: Ensure your changes do not break any existing functionality.
5. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once you're satisfied with your changes, push your branch to your fork and submit a pull request to the `develop` branch of the main repository. Provide a detailed description of your changes.
6. **Review**: Your pull request will be reviewed. Participate in the review discussion and make any necessary changes.

## Commit Message Guidelines

- Keep your commits as granular as possible. Each commit should represent one logical change.
- Use an imperative tone: "Fix bug" not "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug".
- Start the commit message with a capital letter.
- Do not end the commit message with a period.
